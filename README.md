# [The Rook Shop](https://therookshop.herokuapp.com/ "The Rook Shop")

## Description
A full-stack E-Commerce web application made with **MongoDB, Express.js, React/Redux, Node.js** or the **MERN** stack. This web app is complete with **User Authentication and Authorization** thanks to [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/ "JWT") and keeps track of Users, Products, Orders. It utilizes the [PayPal API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/ "PayPal Developer Docs") for customer payment information and checkout. It also uses React Bootstrap for creating re-usable React components to use throughout the app. I built the backend API that returns Products, Users, and Orders using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "Postman").
